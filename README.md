# Pragmatic drag and drop examples

I was trying to learn atlassian's Pragmatic drag and drop and found it a little difficult to understand their docs and official app examples so while I was learning I put together these two simple examples of using for sortable lists and multi container sortable lists.  The code is commented I hope it makes sense and good luck!

They are both heavily inspired by the official examples (and probably much worse) you can find them [here]("https://atlassian.design/components/pragmatic-drag-and-drop/examples")

### Examples
- Very simple single reoderable list
- More complex board with multi container and reorderable columns

### Technology used
- React
- React router (for basic pages)
- Tailwindcss
- Lucide react
- Pragmatic drag and drop
